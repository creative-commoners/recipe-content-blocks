## SilverStripe Content Blocks recipe

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/silverstripe/recipe-content-blocks.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/silverstripe/recipe-content-blocks)

This includes the following core SilverStripe and CWP modules:

 * [silverstripe/recipe-cms](https://github.com/silverstripe/recipe-cms): Recipe containing CMS, versioned, asset-admin, etc
 * [dnadesign/silverstripe-elemental](https://github.com/dnadesign/silverstripe-elemental): Adds content "elements" to
   your pages
 * [silverstripe/elemental-blocks](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-elemental-blocks): Adds some standard
   content blocks

This can be either added to an existing project or used as a project base for creating a basic CWP install.
